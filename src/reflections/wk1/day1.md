# CodeWorks Orientation (Day 1)

Today was my first day as a student at CodeWorks Boise

## In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git to collaborate on code projects, control updates and changes from one update (push) to the next. It's a system that helps us manage the complexities that come with having multiple developers work together on shared projects.


## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple developers can work on branches independently, and then the changes can be merged later into the master branch. Enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. While also being able to revert to versions of the code that were more stable, or less complex if needed. Branches can also be reviewed before being merged - helping ensure a project's functionality remains intact before an update is pushed to the main code.


## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a Version Control System - software that maintains versions on a local device repository. GitHub is a remote repository - in essence, an online content storage system primarily used for programming work becuase of the features it offers. I believe other remote repositories exist, but GitHub is far and away the most popular especially for open source development.
