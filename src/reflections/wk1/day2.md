# CSS (Day 2)

## What is a Psuedo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A psuedo-class is a sub-category of a class that creates special rules based on a combination of the rules in the parent class and new rules tied to an event affecting elements in that class. A good example of a commonly used psuedo-class is "hover", changing the color of a button when a mouse hovers over it. Or changing the shape of a mouse cursor based on that same event.

## What is specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity are built-in rules that enable CSS to decide what rules should be applied to an element when multiple rules might be targeting the same element with different values. You could use specificity in alignment with the priority of items on your page to have elements display specific colors to indicate that priority.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

You could end up trying to make changes to classes in your style sheet, or expect certain values to display on your webpage only to find that an !important element is interrupting your hard work. The larger your files get, the worse of a task it will be to hunt down all the times !important was used that are overriding the changes you're now trying to make.
