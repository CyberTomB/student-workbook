# What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Using color and weight to indicate hierarchy over size. While I think I could have figured out this content if asked to truly take in a webpage and what draws the eyes where, I don't know if I had ever noticed the subtlty of changing those aspects of an element on the page. And here I was just going out throwing "h1" tags on anything important, and "h4" if it should subtitle it xD.

# Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

A website that is really helpful for building out more interesting bootsrap layouts is https://bootswatch.com/. For examples of website design I might want to one day emulate, my first thoughts were https://netrunnerdb.com/ and https://www.duolingo.com/

# How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

A well-designed website is going to instill trust for me to be willing to revisit the website, potentially leading me to make a purchase if that's the end-goal. Design can convey professionalism, it could convey a kind of integrity - I mean, a good design is a sign of investment in every layer of your web-based product. I think that's what brings out trust and confidence in the consumers of said product.
