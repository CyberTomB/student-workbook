# Wire-Framing (Day 4)

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Creating a model and framework of your web or app design at the most rudimentary level. This enables you to identify pain points or make realizations about decisions in the design process with a low amount of invested effort so as to change these concepts before moving on to higher-labor steps in the process.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low, mid, and high-fidelity are the levels described with wireframes. At a low fidelity, we can put the most basic ideas down to see how things might look in the broadest possible sense. At mid fidelity, we can use mockups to express more detail about the type of content we want displayed and how. Finally, at high fidelity, we can achieve as close to a fully realized idea of our final design as we can get before moving on to actual completion. This is useful for fine-tuning concepts that might only come out when looking at the finer points on the project.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I believe they typically are. By tackling the design process in this way, we can identify potential issues with the designs we have in mind: well before we ever have to write code. This means that it has a cascading effect on the amount of effort that would otherwise have to be expended in correcting these issues down the line.
