## Thoughts on Week 1

I've learned a lot already and I'm extremely excited to learn even more! I feel like I've done a good job of being prepared for what this course is going to bring, but I've already stumbled into a few hurdles I couldn't have predicted. However, across the projects we were assigned this week, I feel I've truly gained a solid grasp on the fundamentals of designing webpages with Bootstrap.

Having the TA's on site to help with questions that came up in afternoon labs helped immensely of course. And I feel like should any hurdle come up in the future that I just can't seem to breakthrough on my own, I am confident that the resources BCW has at their disposal can get me through.

Looking forward to the next 12 weeks!
