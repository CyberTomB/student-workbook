# C# List (Week 10 Day 2)

## What is a List in C#?

A List is is an IEnumerable data structure of any chosen type. Similar to an array, but with a more dynamic range of methods that can be called over the list. 

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

.Find, .Add, .Contains, and .Exists seem particularly useful. There can be a lot of cases where a new class object needs to be "stored" somewhere within your program, and using .Add to append that new object to a list and later being able to locate that same object are pretty fundamental behaviors.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

.Find would return the item itself that I would look for. Or, at least, the first item in the list that matches the sought result (which would usually be equally useful).
