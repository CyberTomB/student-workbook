# Working with Enums (Week 10 Day 4)

# What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is essentially a way of assigning symbolic "names" to integers, which allows you to utilize lists of values in more consistent, type-safe ways.

## How can you modify an Enum?

You can reassign the starting constant to an integer other than 0, or you can change the base type of the integral values.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I could use an enum to ensure that responses in a rock-paper-scissors console game can be validated and that the values of the user responses can be "read" in a more direct way.
