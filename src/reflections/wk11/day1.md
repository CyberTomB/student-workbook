# C# Inheritance (Week 11 Day 1 (Tuesday))

## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to pass properties and identity from one class to another.

## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

A derived class needs to be declared as an extension of a base class. The derived class can inherit all of its parents members: except for members whose accessibility is restricted.

## How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Private members cannot be inherited (except in nested inheritance) and internal members can only be visible if the derived class is in the same assembly as the base class.
