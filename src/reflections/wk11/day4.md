# Reflections (Week 11 Day 4 (Friday))

I'm optimisic generally about the final project. So far, I haven't run into any major hurdles when it comes to completing checkpoint projects. I'll confess, I've had a touch of senior-itis during these last two weeks learning C#. However, I do feel confident that I understand the concepts we have covered so far. If anything, I may experience just a bit of sloggishness while building the server-side aspects of the project. Only because I may need to reference lecture repositories more than I would in comparison to a Node server.

I can't believe it's been 3 months already! Well, they say time flies when you're having fun. This has been a great bootcamp experience so far!
