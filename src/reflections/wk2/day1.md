# Intro to Javascript (Week 2 Day 1)

## What is Scope ?

Scope is the range within your program document that a variable object can be read in.

## What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting means to bring information in your program document to the top of the document while it is being interpreted. For instance, bringing variable declarations to the top of the document before processing the rest of the data.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

In general, it's best to use let for nearly all variable declarations. However, in situations where you do not want the data within a variable to change, "const" makese sense. Var could be used in cases maybe where you need to declare something within a code block but want to be able to affect it outside of the scope of said block. But generally, using "let" makes sense becuase it's scoped the block it was declared in.
