# Interacting with the DOM & Events (W2-D3)

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

You can use console.log() to have your code write information to the console. You can also use console.error() which you can use to warn yourself or other developers of issues with the way they are interacting with your code.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab. It's useful for seeing what your HTML and CSS are doing, and make changes on the fly to see how they would affect your page. Just be sure to copy down the changes you made before refreshing the page!

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can use the debugger inside of the Source tab, add breakpoints to your code and use the debugger features to step through the logic of your code line by line in "real" time.
