# Timeouts, Intervals, Local Storage (W2-D4)

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

You could save yourself a significant portion of time. By thinking ahead about how your code should look, you can avoid having to re-write portions of your code that you could have simply written correctly on the first pass becuase you knew how it would need to be structured.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google it first. Then ask for help from peers with more experience.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Writing "why" comments rather than "what" is pretty big - the code should generally speak for itself as much as possible. Also being skeptical about where and why before writing conditional statements, and checking to see if your conditions can be written more simply.

Also knowing data structures and which are appropriate to your project and why. This seems like something I'll understand more and better as time goes on but it's good to be paying attention to this information as we go forward.
