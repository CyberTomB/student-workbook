# Feelings going into Week 3 (W2-D5)

I'm excited! I feel I've a firm grasp on the fundamentals of javascript, HTML, and CSS. I see how and why they affect the webpage in the ways that they do. And while I obviously don't have all the syntax and methods memorized, or even the beginning of a complete understanding of the depths to which these languages can go: I feel I can start to see how much I've yet to really learn.

I'm hopeful that the next few weeks will introduce use to the practical real-world tools and techniques that make browsing the internet the modern experience that it is today.

I get the sense it will be like stepping out of the Stone Age into the Bronze Age!
