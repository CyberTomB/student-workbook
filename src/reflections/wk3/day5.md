# Thoughts and Feelings on Week 3 (Day 5)

To be honest, this week was challenging for me in my personal life. I didn't get things done in the afternoons that I was hoping to. This was due to a series of unexpected changes to my life's schedule, sad news, and a touch of classic procrastination.

However, I felt that I understood the concepts of encapsulation, modules and export/import and class functions very well. Hopefully I'm not overlooking some kind of blatant hole in my understanding, but if I find that I am - I know what resources I can turn to with BCW.

I'm excited to see how we expand on these ideas going into next week. And I feel I have learned what steps I need to take in my personal life to make sure I am more on top of my schedule and dedicating my time to the right priorities for this class. I know I met, at the very least, the minimum requirements for this week's checkpoint. But I'd like to see myself go further and reach those stretch goals in the future.
