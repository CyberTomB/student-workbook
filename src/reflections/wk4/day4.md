## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REpresentation State Transfer: Meaning that when a RESTful API is called, the server *transfers* a *representation* of the *state* of the requested resource.

## What does Stateless mean?

The server does not remember anything about the user using the API. It keeps no "state" of the user making requests to the server. 

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

URLs need to provide unique identifiers for retrieving specific endpoints of the API.
