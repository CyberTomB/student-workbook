# Intro to NodeJS (Week 5 Day 1)

## What is the purpose of a Query String?

It allows you to pass information to and from a website inside of the URL.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter always starts with a "?", and then key-value pairs are written as key=value, using "&" to separate the parameters of the query. 

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

They would be helpful in creating search functions in order to access objects in a database using only partial matching data.
