# Introduction to Vue (Week 6 Day 1)

## What is Component based architecture?

It's a web design architecture that builds websites using "components." Components are, in essence, the style, structure, and function of every aspect of your website rolled together into one document. These documents are meant to stay relatively small, but you can use a lot of them to build self-sufficient aspects of your website and integrate them together at the end.

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

The page can load and refresh relevant *parts* of your web page without requiring a full refresh. Encapulation and single responsibility are practically built in as well. Which also allows for effective simultaneous coding and less merge conflicts.

## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Because of the extreme mode of encapsulation, the readability of your overall code can go down. CBA is perhaps best utilized as a tool that handles only relevant aspects of your code, and not necessarily the structure on which the entire web application is built.
