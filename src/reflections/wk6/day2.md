# Vue Architecture (Week 6 Day 2)

## What are props?

Props are essentially variable information that can be passed almost like parameters from one component to another. 

## What are props used for?

Props can help us create more dynamic templates and offer flexibility when integrating components into our pages.

## Where can props be used or accessed?

They can be used by the child elements of a component that defines them. You can access them inside of methods, computed props, and other Javascript.
