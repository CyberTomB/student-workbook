# Using Nested Routes (Week 6 Day 4)

## What is a nested route?

A nested route is when you've got a route URL path defined inside the "children" of an existing route URL path.

## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

You could create routes dynamically, passing variable information in order to have links refer to child elements throughout your app.

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes you can. You can use them to send information along with the re-direct so that the newly rendered page displays some elements from the prior page.
