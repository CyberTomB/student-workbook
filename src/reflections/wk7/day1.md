## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is the act of working in teams of two on the same code. One member takes on the role of "navigator" and the other the "driver." Generally speaking, the navigator provides oversight and direction while the driver sits at the keyboard putting words to the file.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
     
There are typically better outcomes in terms of the code quality, which saves developers from having to do work again later down the road to fix errors.

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

When measuring labor in terms of something like cost-per-person-per-hour, you're paying two people to do work that typically culminates in one person writing at a keyboard. There can also be issues arising from the relationship between the paired programmers.
