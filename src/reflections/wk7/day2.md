## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is the adding of plain english guides or notes to help yourself or other future programmers who might need to review your code.  You can create how-to guides, an extensive README file, or use tools like JSDocs to inject notes right into the code.

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

It's easier to review. You can leave reminders for yourself to review what you were thinking when you were writing the code originally. It can also help other developers later down the line to know how to use your code.

## How important is Code documentation and why?

It's important to good development that can be used openly with relative ease. At the end of the day, the code you write is most likely going to be read by a human; possibly even more than a machine. Good documentation translates to good communication between yourself and other developers.
