## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

A user experience is the interaction that any given user has with your end product. You should consider the emotions you want to elicit, the usability of your front-end, and how you can get your users to do what they *want* to do.

## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

Good UX will bring users back. If they enjoyed the experience of using your site or service, they are more than likely going to want to return to that experience.

## Why is the User Experience important?

It drives engagement - which is fundamentally the end-goal of web and software development. The more users you have, the better of a product you've ultimately developed.
