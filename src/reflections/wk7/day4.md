## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
 
I think we implemented some of the best practices from partner coding really well. In particular, while not the exact same thing as described, the "ping-pong" coding concept came up at moments where one of us would write till we hit a wall, then would pass the buck to the other partner.

## What went well?

By the end of the project, we had a pretty robust UX considering the relative lack of planning we implemented. I think we worked well off each other to make sure elements were appearing on the page in intuitive ways -- and providing feedback on what we would expect or want to see.
 
## What would you do differently?

One thing I think we could have done better about was mapping out the terminology and overall design pattern we wanted to approach the project with. There was some confusion that resulted form relatively poor naming conventions.
