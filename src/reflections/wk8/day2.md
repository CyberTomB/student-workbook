## Why is communication on a small team important?

Communicating helps keep the team informed of the needs of the client and the constraints or hurdles other team members might be facing while working through a sprint.

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

This will largely depend on the scope and needs of the project and the team. Sometimes, having fewer but more expansive meetings can open more time to the actual *doing* part of writing code.

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The three corners of the triangle are: good, fast, cheap. You can't have more than 2. This means that your team should decide on what the least important aspect is for your client, and trade off that aspect in order to achieve the other two. For example, you can make your product *good* and *fast* but it won't come *cheap*.
