## What is Software Development Testing?

Unit testing is the process of confirming that code modules perform as the developer expects.

## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

Building tests helps us ensure that the individual parts of our code are working individually, without having to test our system from back-to-front just to confirm a change to a component. It can also help us identify when our code might be ill-conceived, and adjust accordingly.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

There is a labor cost to testing. One other potential downside is if your test is implemented incorrectly, you could end up changing your code to conform to a bad test. The upsides seem to generally outweigh downsides overall, though.
