# Week 9 Day 1

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We're using an external API call to get data from Yelp. We're also accessing device location, and trying to utilize "cache" features in order to temporarily store data and lower our overall API calls.

## What went well so far?

The part of our app that worked surprisingly well was our randomized result feature. I thought this would be one of the more difficult aspects of the project but we ended up getting useful results and could even create custom searches.

## What would you do differently? Why?

I think our team could have used a more principaled "role" structure. If we had assigned people to strict positions within the team to help make executive decisions, or help drive specific processes like organizing our backlog and choosing what needs worked on and who does it. In general, we could have done better to strengthen the overall workflow process and create better feedback loops to know *when* something is done and *what* to do next and who does it. Nonetheless, we came out okay on this in general.
