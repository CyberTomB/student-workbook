## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

In a small team, roles are a lot more fluid and flexible. On larger teams, roles within the SCRUM dynamic are more likely to be rigid and the workload of each team member may not diverge much beyond the scope of their role.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

In order to maintain consistent output and keep the product goals realistic. Splitting sprints can lead to difficulties involving the "unattainable triangle."

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

The triangle is Good, Fast, and Cheap. You can only get two out of a SCRUM. Either it's good and cheap, fast and good, or fast and cheap. You can't - generally - attain all three at the same time. And thus, you should decide in advance what the demands of your end product will be within this "triangle" and make choices accordingly.
